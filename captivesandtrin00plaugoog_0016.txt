3. The first permanent theatre in Rome was the theatre

ol Pompey, finished in 55 ae. In the time oi Plautus a
temporary wooden stage was erected for each performance,
and the audience stood in front ol it or sat upon seats ol
their own providing. From the back wall ol the stage pro
jected the ironts oi three houseS, and there were entrances
at the right and left sides of the stage. lls will be explained
below, the plays were reproductions ol Greek comedies and
the actors wore Greek dress, but masks were not used. Where
the plot of the play required that two characters should re-
semble each other in appearance, as in the Amphitruo and the
Menaechmi, the necessary likeness was produced by wigs and
paints, in the use oi which the Romans were skiliul.

sity lor a break in the action, though in afew plays there
were certainly briei musical interludes. Considerable parts
of the plays were given with musical accompaniment, ren·
dered upon the tibz'a by a player who stood upon the stage.
The portions oi the comedy which are written in trochaic
septenarii (Capi. 2 51-360, 385-496, Trz'n. 301-391, 602—728,
etc.) were declaimed or chanted while the tibicen played a
slight accompaniment in the same measure. In other scenes -
the verse varied, often from line to line, the musical accom-
paniment was more prominent, and the action more nearly
resembled a dance. As this required somewhat violent
exertion, the lines were sometimes sung, not by the actor
himsell, but by a special cantor, while the actor confined
himself to giving the appropriate gestures and motions. The
musical parts oi the play were called cantica. The parts to
be spoken without music, the dz'uerbzia, were written in iambic
senarii. In the Trinummus the ratio ol diuerbia to cantica
is about 2 : 5, in the Captivi about 1 : 3.
