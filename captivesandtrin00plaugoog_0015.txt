Umbria, and his command of the Latin language indicates
that he must have come to Rome early in his lite. There
is no evidence that he was a slave, nor, on the other hand,
that he had the active rights of a Roman citizen. *He is
thus between Livius Andronicus and Terence, on one side,
and Naevius and Ennius on the other. There is a brief
account of his lite in Aulus Gellius, III. 3. 14., in which it
is stated that he made money in some employment about
the theatre, that he lost it on a trading expedition, that he
returned to Rome in poverty and earned his living b'y turn-
ing a handmill, and that while thus engaged he wrote three
plays, This account contains some improbabilities‚ and*
though it is given on the authority of Varro, it must rest
finally on oral tradition, since the Roman records ol Plautus’
time took no account ol literature. ⁴

2. The games ior which the plays ol Plautus were written
were either regular or occasional. The regular games were

the Ludi Megalenses in April, the Ludi Romani or Magni-
in September, and the Ludi Plebeii in November. The
Ludi Apollinares in July were probably not celebrated with
plays during the liletime ot Plautus. Beside these festivals,
plays were performed also at dedication games, such as
those at the dedication of the temple of the Magna Mater
in 191, when the Pseudolus was produced, and at funeral
games. Of the six plays ot Terence, three were written for
the Ludi Megalenses, one for the Ludi Romani, one for the
funeral games of L. Aemilius Paulus, and one, the Hecyra,
was first presented at the Ludi Megalenses, a second time,
unsuccessfully, at the same funeral games, and a third time
at the Ludi Megalenses or the Ludi Romani. The play
was bought by the givers ol the games on the recommenda-
tion ot a theatre managu, a dominus gregis who had atroupe
ot slaves trained in acting. Under his directions the prepa-
rations for presenting the play were made.
