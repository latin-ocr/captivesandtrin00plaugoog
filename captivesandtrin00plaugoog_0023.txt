sound romained in use as ornaments oi style. Alliteration
is frequent (Traia. 26, 28, 33, 34, 35, 38, etc), and is oiten
extended to two or three letters, especially where verbs com-
pounded with the same preposition are used together.
Words with the same termination are oi course common,
but Plautus uses them in such ways as to make it plain that
the rhyme is intentional, ior example, in the first hali oi the
’ trochaic septenarius, qui cibatus conmeatus; et datores et
factorem per medicinas, per tonstrinas; inuenietur, ex-

' quiretur. The repetition oi words oi the same stem in dii-

oculis, amans amantem, etc.) is ot the same nature, and
this is often carried further into the figura etymologica, where
words oi the same stem are brought into close grammatica]
relation. Such combinations as misere miser, nauide
madeo, dicta dicere, laetitia laetus, mernor meminit were
agreeable to the Roman ear, though they lack point to us.
Puns by a play upon different senses oi the same word or

the effect oi the verse or to add to the liveliness oi a pas-
sage, Plautus is not inventing ornaments oi, style, but is
making iree use oi a general peculiarity oi colloquial speech.

in solemn formulas (faustum felixque) and in the most
serious passages (hostis pro hospite, Livy, Ι. 58. 8, in
Lucretia’s words to her husband), where it seems to us
entirely inappropriate.

The syntax oi Plautus is peculiar. On the one hand, col-
loquial language deviates easily irom strict rules and forms
many idioms which take on a meaning different irom that
