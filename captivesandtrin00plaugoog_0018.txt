manuscripts. The oldest oi these, and one oi the oldest oi
existing Latin MSS., is a palimpsest in the Ambrosian
library at Milan. lt was a good copy oi a good original,
made in the fourth or fifth century, and contained the twenty·
one Varronian plays, but in the eighth or ninth century it
was taken to pieces, the parchment was cleaned, and some
oi the leaves were used again ior a copy oi the Latin Old
Testament. The original writing is now very difficult to
read and many parts are missing, but where it can be read
it is ol very great value. The other MSS. all belong to
one class, that is, were cdpied directly or indirectly from a
single archetype different from the archetype oi the Milan
palimpsest. They vary in date from the eleventh to the
thirteenth century, and have been corrupted in transmission
by the errors oi copyists, but it is possible from their read-
ings to reconstruct their original with a fair degree oi accu-
racy and completeness With the help oi the Milan
palimpsest a reasonable approximation can be made to the
text as it existed in the time oi the Antonines. But this is
still iar from the text as Plautus wrote it; the changes due
to errors in the actors' copies, to the revisions oi theatre
managers, to intentional or unintended modernization of
iorms and constructions‚ and to ignorance of the prosody
and metrical laws oi the early Latin can be removed from
the text only by 'conjectural emendation, based upon an ¹
accurate knowledge oi the usage of Plautus. It is not to be
hoped that a text with such a history should ever be as
clearly fixed as the text oi Vergil; a reasonable approximation
is all that can be expected.

are they simple translations; their exact position between
these two extremes is somewhat difficult to fix. The plays
oi the New Comedy from which they were taken were in
part entirely unsuited ior transportation to another race and
