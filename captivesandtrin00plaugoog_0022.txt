11. Plautus uses similes rarely‚ but metaphors condensed
into a few words, or extending to a line or two, are frequent,
and constitute one of the most marked elemeuts of his style.
They are largely drawn from public life or from military
affairs. During the twenty years oi the Second Punic War
the habitual thought of the Roman people musthave become
saturated with military conceptions, and these are recorded
in the popular speech in phrases orturus of thought drawn

(see above, 7) is illustrated here on a small scale. The sol·
diers who appear in several of the plays, usually in a way
that holds them up to ridicule, are always Greek mercenaries;
the figures are from the Greek play, and Plautus makes no
attempt to change thern into the likeness of the Roman
citizen-soldier. But the chance references to war, embodied
in metaphorical phrases, are all Roman, and are an integral
part of the language which he used. The same thing appears
to be true of the metaphors drawn from the sea and sailing
and the weather, aud this fact lends some support to the
tradition handed down by Varro and Gellius that Plautus
had been a mercator, a trader by sea, before he wrote plays.

12. Though Plautus was not acquainted with the rhetori·

essential part, perhaps the very foundation, of verseforms.

of verse, founded upon accent or quantity or rhyme at the
end oi thelina, had come in, the earlier correspondences of
