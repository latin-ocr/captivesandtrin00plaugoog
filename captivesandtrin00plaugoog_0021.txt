and force, the same idea is repeated in slightly varying
form. ln the case of single words this tendency results in
pairs of nearly synonymous words, which in some cases
became fixed in colloquial speech so that they were no
longer felt as two words, but as one. This is especially
marked with adverbs of time and place. Pairs of nouns and
of verbs are more frequently used with a consciousness of
the difference between them, though even here there is tre-
quentlya lack of precision in the choice of the words. With
the larger unitsâ€š phrases and clauses and even sentenceS,
repetition is a distinct mark of the style of Plautus. But
here a careful examination will show that it is not mere
repetition3 it is the effort of conversation to approximate
the exact thought by dropping one form of expression and

substituting another which seems more precise or which

exhibits the thought from a better side. See, for example,

Capt. 401 ff, 430 ff, 461 ff, 710 ff. Here it is possible to

follow the expansion of the thought in the speaker's mind

and to see how he is substituting a particular thought ior a

general statement, or a more adequate expression for an

imperfect one. In some semi-lyrical passages, however, like

Capt. 768 ff, 902 ff, Plautus is simply running riot in a

comic exuberance of words.

The order of words and phrases calls for little comment.
It is the natural order of conversation, which takes the
thoughts as they come into the mind, without any regard for
the periodic structure of the sentence, orior the rhetorical
and artificial arrangements which are to be found in later
prose. It therefore bears more resemblance in its order to
English colloquial style than to the Latin of literature. As
in our conversation, many phrases have become fixed in
their order, andare used again and again without variation.
Metrical necessity was less felt than might be expected.
Latin words fall eadmero iambic senarii, especially when
