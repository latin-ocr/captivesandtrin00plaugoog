The Trinummus has little of the brilliancy of style and
the overflowing humor which characterize the Bacchides, the
Pseudolus, the liudem, the Miles Gloriosus,· but the central

it may be said to show a more uniform artistic excellence.
It ranks well with plays of the second grade, like the
Aulularia, the Mcmmmi, the Poenulus.
