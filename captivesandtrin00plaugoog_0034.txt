rwrnonucrron. xxix

29· a) quom explicative‚ after expressions oi emotion, etc, has the
indic: capt. 297, 11111 officium hic suom, quom tibist confessus
uerum; Most. 149, cor dolet, quom sci0; Men. 1148, quom tu’s
liber, gaudeo; Most. 719, amice facis, quom me laudas. Translate
“ that,’' ‘⁴ in that‚” without temporal 10111, and cf. quod, quia. This use
01 quom (cum) occurs in Cicero.

b) The temp'oral clause with the lmpf. and plupf. subjunctive is
not yet in use in Pl. The tempora] quom-clauses with pres. or perf.
subjunc. are either independent subjunctives (9011111111, indefinite
second pers.) or are subjunc. by attraction: Ps. 137, quos quom
ferias, tibi plus noceas ; Amph. 542, ut, quom absim, me ames;
Ps. 168, ne mora quae sit, cocus quom ueniat, about fifty cases.

, With these (apparent) exceptions the temporal quom-clause in Pl.

always has the indic, about 225 cases.

c) quom cabsel-adversative may have the subjunc. in some three or
four cases (Q Ps. 184); 11 has the subjunc. by attraction a few
times, but regularly quom causal-adversative takes the indic: Bacch.
1005511511 suspectus 511111, quom careo noxia; Capt. 244, quom
antehac pro iure imperitabam meo, nunc te oro per precem.

3⁰· quoniam has in a few cases pure temporal meaning: Trr'n. 149,
quoniam hinc profectust . ..thensaurum demonstrauit mihi;
Mil. 129, quoniam inspexi mulieris sententiam, cepi tabellas;
Asin. 350 ; Trin.14; Capt. 930.

31. quod in Pl. is rarely, if ever, causal.

a) As a conjunction it is scarcely to be distinguished from the pron.
in acc. of compass and extent: Ps. 9, quid 151, quod tu . . . gestas
tabellas tecum. . .? Merc. 364, quid illuc 151, quod solus secum
fabulatur filius? and often with quid est quod.

b) With verbs 01 emotion (cf. quom): Capt. 996, quod male feci,
crucior; Mil. Glor. 469, 11111115 beat, quod conmeatus transtinet3
Pom. 1373111 mirere, mulieres quod eum sequntur. This is also
found in later Latin.

32· quia is usually causa13 there are more than 250 cases against
possibly half a dozen of quod causal. After verbs of emotion: Capt.
prol. 59,111 ucreamini quia . . .dixi; Capt. 203, at nos pudet, quia
cum catenis sumus; Mil. 1222, iactast, quia ted adiit3 Mil. 1328,

1111111110, quia diiungimur.
