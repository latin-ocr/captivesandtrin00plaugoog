fotius albam, scimur, audibam, are regular for ιίοδιιιι, aiebam. But
synizesis in most nouns, filio, gratiis (later gratis), is rare aud is cou-
fned to the less regular meters.

39· Final s was into Cicero's time a lightly sounded letter; it is
frequently omitted in inscriptions, and does not make position when the
following word begins with a consonant, even in the sixth foot of iambic
senarius ι saluis sis, estis nunc, perdis me, etc. So also ain for ais-m,
satin for satis-ue, etc. For this reason es, est unite freely with a pre
ceding word ending in s; sariu's = sanus es, potitust = potitus est,
unicust = unicus est, nactu's = nactus es, etc. Examples of these
usages may be found 'rn abundance in any play.

40· Either from frequent use or from some wealrness in the conso-
nant sounds, ille, iste, inde, uude, nempe have the first syllable short:
luto has a form ste, though notin Plautus; in ills the double liquid
was wealr (cf. olim); iude and liudo may be due to wealruess of the
sound of n, as udmpe is certainly to be explained by the wealrened
pronunciation of m.

41· That syncope occurs in Plautus, as in later Latin, is plain, agn:

discipulina and disciplina, poplo = populo, poclum = poculum, peri-
clum =pericu1um, but the extent of the usage has not been fixed.
Perhaps iuuentute in three syllables (cf. iunior) uoluptabilis in four
syllables, cauillationes in five syllables; but all of these may be ex·
plained, aud usually are, by the effect of accent, 46, 47, below.

42· A mute and a liquid never lengthen the preceding vowel in
Plautus: expriibrs, tigrum, pitrl.

43· Many inflectional endings, which were shortened under the
intluence of the accent or for other reasons before the Augustan age,
retain in Plautus invariably or occasionally their original long quantity.
Thus invariably es, indic. and impv. from esse, br in verbs (noodr,
ioquin), in nouus (ceutbr, ambr), in comparatives (auctibr) and in
ecustbr. The original length of conjugatione] endings is occasionally
retained in the third pers. sing. of the perf. (uixit), of the pres. (scit, tt),
of the subjunctive (sit, tuit, uelit, desideret, etc), and sometimes in
other forms (eris, egit). There are a few probable cases of si in the
nom. of the first decl. (cf. gen. in ui) and in the abl. of the third decl.
-6 (sermoni, morib). Other early quantities diifering from the Augus-
tan usage ere tuit, filiatum fieri, fierem at the end of a verse (cf. fi⁰ii
