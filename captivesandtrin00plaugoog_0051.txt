8 PLAVTI

Neque spdrcidici insunt udrsus immemorabiles:
Hic neque periurus lenost nec meretrix mala
Neque miles gloriosus: ne ueredmini,

Quia bellum Aetolis esse dixi cum ilicis:

Foris illic extra scaenam fient proelia.

Nam hoc paene iniquomst‚ cdmico choragio
Conari desubito agere nos tragoediam.

Proin siquis pugnam exspectat, litis cdntrahat:
Valentiorem nactus aduorsarium

Si erit, ego faciam ut pdgnam inspectet non bonam, 65
Adeo dt spectare pdstea omnis dderit.

Abeo. ualete, iddices iustissumi,

Domi duellique duellatores optumi.

56. immemorabiles‚ which
should not be spoken, from the
sense of memorare, speole, tell,
which is the usual one in Pl.

60. ioris illic extra scaenam:
this kind oi pleonasm belongs
properly to colloquial style, and
is therefore very common in Pl:
illic ibi, 100ος ibidem in Alide, 263
pone aedem Castoris ibi, Cure. 481;
tum igitur, igitur demum, etc.;
Introd. ro.

67. iudices: this can be used

between different authors, as in
Greece.

68. duelli, duellatores=belli‚

in old laws. Cf. duonoro=bono

The prologus cannot be wholl
by Plautus. Vs. rz, with the rel
erence to fixed seats, cannot he
earlier than 146 rae, when perma-
nent seats were first introduced.
With 12 must go 11-16, and prob
ably 8-10 also. Vss. 21-22 are
out ol place where they stand,
and there is no other place where
they fit in well, though Brix puts
them aiter 4. Vss. 46-49 and 50-
51 merely condense what is said
