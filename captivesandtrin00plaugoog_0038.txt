INTRODUCTION. xxxlll

erunt in third plu. perf. indic. Most of these occur rarely‚ and they
have a lew parallels in Horace and Vergil: timet, uerit, etetdmnt, etc.

44. The strongest influence in producing differences
between the prosody of Plautus and that of Horace and
Vergil was exerted by the accent. The Latin usage which
tended to fix the accent upon the penult or antepenult‚ with-
drew from the ultima a preservative force, and expedited the
shortening and dropping off oi inflectional endings. This
process went on during the whole history oi the language‚
but it was much more rapid and extended in the spoken
than in the written Latin. For this reason, though he
preceded Vergil by a century and a hali, Plautus has many
more cases ol syllables shortened by the accent than any
Augustan poet.

45· Iambic words (ύ ,l are frequently shortened to pyrrhica
(ύ υ), whether the last syllable ends in a vowel or a consonant. So
domi, ιιόιιό, noui, boul, ulrl; the imperatives libi, tene, alde, habe,
dmi, etc.; and before consonants, dedln, ulrde, prdciil, ρέῐίἱιιι, cipit,
rigat, eduin, etc. In milri, tibi, sibi, ubi the influente of the accent
makes the last syllable occasionally short (common) even in classical
poetry‚ and regularly bene, mile. Examples of this are very common,

· and iu inscriptions the final consonant ol some of these words is

onritted. But when the word is emphatic and therefore distinctly pro·
nounced the final syllable may preserve its length, nale, abi.

4⁶· In the versent Plautus the metrical ictus may exert the same
influence as the word-aecem, when it falls upon the short syllable of an
iambic combination This rs most frequent with short monosyllables
followed by a long monosyllable or by a word the first syllable oi which
is long· le est, lin ille ,de hl'c, quir l'n manu, per hinc, rit lriinc ,quis
haec, etc.; οι with elision, tibi ergo, qula ln re, nl'si hilum with longer
words, qudd ecbibit, quid exprobras, ige accumbe, qudi intellexi,
mage Inmortales, qula abstulisti, etc.

47· Further‚ the effect of the' retus is sometimes exerted backwards,
so as to shorten a preceding long syllable, when that syllable is itseli
preceded by a short syllable. Thus dedlsse exponendam, sed istuc,

ego includor, bhnum Ingenium, nd lintrem, per annonam, ln brchlto,
