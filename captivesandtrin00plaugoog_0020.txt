to say that it is conversational Latin. It is such Latin as
would have been spoken by a quick-witted man with a great
command oi language and a strong sense oi humor, and it
shows in many ways the peculiarities oi colloquial language.
The range oi thought is limited‚ yet the voeabulary is rich
and is used with a kind of profusion, as though the writer

had never been at a loss ior a word. Many fixed and idio· ⁴

matie phrases recur again and again, and the reader who
has read two or three plays with care will lind little that is
absolutely new in other plays, except the occasional rare
words. In their meaning the words not infrequently differ
from classieal usage, either because they have not yet
acquired the prevailing classical sense, or because they are
colloquially wrested from their strict meaning. Many words,
especially adjectives‚ are used with little discrimination‚ until

same characteristics are found in all colloquial speech. In
slang terms, that is, in words twisted out oi their proper
sense ior comic effect, Plautus is particularly rich, especially
in nouus and verbs which express cheating‚ of which a long
list might be given, some oi them corresponding to English
slang, and in terms oi abuse and endearment‚ which occa·
sionally fill three or four lines, Plautus also coins words
treely, not onlyinsuchproper names as'shensaurochrysonico
chrysides (Capi. 285) and Vaniloquidorus Virginisuendo-
niues (Pers. 70² ft), but also in more ordinary compounds
and derivatives, where the meaning would at once explain
itseli to the hearer.

lary leads often to redundancy oi expression, such as char-
acterizes all conversation. In the effort to attain to cleamess
