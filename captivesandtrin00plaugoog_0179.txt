thought and the absence of a sub
jeci for effugiet make it probable
that a vs. has fallen out after 596,
as Ritschl thought.

598. malam crucem: cf. Capt.
469 n.

599. latrocinatum, to serve as a
mercenary soldier. So in Mil.
Glor. 74 the captain calls the men
whom he has recruited latrones.
The meaning robber is secondapp.
The frequent references in come
to mercenary soldiers and bragging
captains are all from the Greek.
The Roman soldiers were still
citizens.

erru Scurra. As Stasimus is
turning to go away Callicles comes
hurriedly out of his house, having
heard of the betrothal. He ques-
tions Stasimus somewhat sharply,
and Stasimus, believing that Cal·
licles has cheated his master (601,
615 n), replies as impudently as
he dares.

602. quomodo.. .dixti?what’s
that you sarii? quomodo is some-
times used literally and unemo-
tionally, but it is also used either
witha verb (always 2d pers. perf.
oi a verb of saying) or alone, to
demand a repetition. The latter
is the sense here. Stasimus first
answers the question as it was
meant, by a repetition oi the state·
ment, and then adds em, hoc
modo, as if quomodo had been
literal. cf. Pseud. 343 for a simi-
lar play upon theword. It should
be noticed that Stasimus had not
said this in the preceding scene,
noris there any indication that
Callicles overheard the conversa-
tion between Lesbonicus and
Philto. Plautus isoften careless
insuchmatters.-nostrum erilem
illium, our master'sson‚ noster erus
being treated as a kind of corn·
pound noun; Mil. Glor. 458 ς 549,
etc.
