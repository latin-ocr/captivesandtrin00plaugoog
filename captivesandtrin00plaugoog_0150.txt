ADVLESCENS

Multis res simitu in meo corde udrso,

Multum ln cogitindo doldrem indipiscor.

Egomet me coquo et macero et deietlgo: ²25
Magister mihi exercitdr animus ndnc est.

Sed hoc non liquet neque satls cogitdtumst,

Vtrdm potius hirum mihi irtem expete'ssam,

221. The subjunctives are all
due to the influence of the preced-

'sumn Scene. The actor,
dressed in rich and brightcolored
clothing to represent a young man,

232, 242-2 56, 271-27 5) fall easily

such form that they can be reduced
to meter only by many'and violent
changes. Such passages present
metrical and critical problems
which, without further knowledge
oi Roman music and dancing, are
not likely to be solved. ln the
text as printed these passages are
not marked with accents.

old form oi the prepos. indu,
which appears also in a few other
compounds, indandirc, induo, in-
digeo, indigena, industria, indupe-
rator (Enn, Luem), etc.
