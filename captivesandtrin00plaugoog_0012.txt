PREFACE.

-οοο-

Trra text oi these plays is from the Teubner Text oi
Goetz and Schoell. Changes have been made not infre,-¹
quently to get a readable text and less often to get correct
meter. A few of the more corrupt passages are leit as they
appear in the MSS.

The introduction an'd notes are intended to be such as
will give real help to students in ¹college classes. They

Ι - make no claim whatever to originality. The sections in

the ,introduction on the syntax oi Plautus contain a good
deal of matter which has not before been brought together,
and may be oi use to instructors as well as to students.
The remarks on the relation of the Captives to its Greek
original are new3 I hope they are also true.
