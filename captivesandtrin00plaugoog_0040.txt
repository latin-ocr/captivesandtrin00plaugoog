49. The date of the composition of the Captivos is not
known, either absolutely or in relation to other plays of
Plautus. The Greek original also is unknown, but no war Ι
between the Aetolians and the people of Elis can have*
occurred before the year 314 nc, when the Aetolians first
came into diplomatic relations with the Peloponnesian states.

5ο. The scene of the play is Aetolia (nom Aetolia hoec
est, 94), which Plautus evidently thinks of as a city, not a

slave-life which sets the tone of other plays is not repre·
sented at all. The parts of the lororii, the puer, and Stalag-
mus are entirely subordinate, and while Tyndarus was a
slave in Elis he appears in the play as captiuos rather than
