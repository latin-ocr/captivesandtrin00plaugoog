c) eadem, eadem opera, “at the same time '¹ (Most. 1039, Capt.
293, 4593 Mil. θίαν. 303, etc), is always used ot two future acts which
are to be performed at the same time, and usually with lut. or fut. peri.
To be distinguished troni una opere . . . qua, “as well . . . as.” ,

d) quisquis, quisque, and quicumque, all containing a duplication

oi the iudei. interrog. quis, are not yet fully differentiated in use ι so
quoquo modo, Men. 827, “in every way ”3 unum quidquid, Trin. 881,
tor unum quidque; quidquid, Most. 831, etc, all non-relative, and
so eveninCicero. Forplu1.otquisquls, quicumqueisused. quisque
is used tor quisquis or quicumque (as indef. rel.): Mil θίαν. 156,

offendero, “whomsoever Ι meet,” and ofteu; also in late Latin.
quilubetis in Pl. only partially ‘felt as a compound, but quiuis some
what more clearly.

e) ln early Latin quis, iudei. or interrog, had no iem. lorm (cf.
Greek rh), and in Pl. quae is just coming into use. So quis, quisquis,-
quisquam, quisque, quempiam, etc, all lem, but no case ot lem.
aliquis or ecquis. F ern. quae, iudei. or interrog.,is also used, but less
frequently: Mil. Glor. 361, illaec quis est mulier? Merc. 684,

haud, Bacch. 19, 1037; Pers. 535 ς Epid. 664, etc.; non . . . nemini,
Mil. Glor. 1411. Probably a colloquialism ; also in Petronius, Apuleius,
and Gellius.

c) nec, not conuective = neque, but = neque, ‘⁸ not in any way‚''
“not at all ”: necullum, Trin. 2823 nec recte dicere = male dicere,
Most. 24o; Ps. 108 5; Asin. 155, 471, etc. This usage is found also in
later Latin, and should not be explained by supplying another member
