INTRODUCTION. xxxvii

seruulus callidus (266 ff, 516 ff, 534 ff, 662 i), and Philo
crates in a less degree plays the part of the young man
who profits by the trickery. li the original play is vulgarized
in the hands of Plautus, as it is, and the result talls short
ot justifying the high praise that has been given to the Cap
tives‚ it still presents a most interesting illustration oi the
mingling of different elements3 and a caretul observation ot
the play from this point oi view will greatly assist the
reader toward an understanding oi the nature of Latin
comedy.

Tur anwuunus

An approximation to the date of the Trinummus has been
made by Ritschl from the mention of the noui aediles (990).
This can mean only the aediles who have just entered upon
their duties. During the lifetime oi Plautus the aediles
were inaugurated on the Ides of March3 this would suggest
that the play was presented at the Megalensian Games in
April'(1ntrod. 2). These games were not celebrated with
plays before the year 194 rae. There is, therefore, a rea-
sonable probability that the play belongs to the last decade
of Plautus' lif .

The Greek original is given in the prologue, the Θῃσαυρός
of Philemon (floruit 330 nc).

Of the houses which projected from the back wall of the

stage one was occupied by Callicles one by Megaronides, ·

and a third, probably, by Philto (276) and his son Lysiteles.
The house occupied by Callicles had belonged to Charmides,
and his son Lesbonicus had reserved a lodging in the back
partor the house when he sold the property to Callicles
(194). The entrance to this lodging isin some passages

(1079, 1174 f.) represented as different from the front door
oi Callicles' house, but in 400 f. Lesbonicus appears through
