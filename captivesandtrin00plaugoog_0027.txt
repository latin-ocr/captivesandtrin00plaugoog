xxii INTRODUCTION.

c) ad in the sense ot apud: Copt. 699, in libertatest ad patrem in
petria; Capt. prol. 49, ut . . . hic ad suom maneat patrem ; Ass'n.82 5,
ad amicam potare, Stich. 439 iubebo ed Sagarinum cenam coqui.

d) Iu constructions of fime and place prepositions are sometimes
used and sometimes omitted without affecting the meaning; this varia-
tion is a survival from the adverbial stage.

With the abl. of “time when ’³ no prepos. is used if the noun has an
attributive adj, pron, or gen. ι Pers. 264, die uno ς Touo. 497, decumo
mense ; Merc. 33, aduorso tempore. But with the noun alone in is
used: Capt. 836, intempore aduenis, Bacch. 1127, in enno. There
are some exceptions to this usage.

For the “time within which ” there is no fixed usage: Copt. 168,
in his diebus; Most. 238, his decem diebus, Pers. 37, in hoc triduo.

Names of towns are put in acc. of place to which, abl. of place from
which, and abl. or loc. of place in which without a preposition, except
Ephesus (Ephesum or in Ephesum, Epheso or ex Epheso, Ephesios
in Epheso) and in Epidaurum, in Elatiam, in Sicyonem. Piraeus and
Seleucia are always used with prepos. Acheruns is treated as the name
of a town.

With names of small islands there is no fixed usage t Cyprum or ln
cyprum, Rhodo or ex Rhodo.

Names of countries usually have the prepos., but Aegypto, Most.
4403 Ponto, Truc. 540; Alidem, Copt. 5733 Alide, Copt. 330. Greek
names in ·us are used without prepos. in good prose.

19· a) The persona] pronouns in nom. are expressed in some cases
where they are not emphatic, but the limitations of this usage have
never been accurately fixed. Plautus observes certain customs in re·
gard to order of pers. pron. : nom. before oblique case (egotibi, tute
tibi); subject of infin. precedes other cases (te ad me ad cenam dic
uenturum, Most. 11343 Copt. 243, 249, etc.); acc. precedes other
oblique cases (me sibi, te mihi); dat. precedes abl. or acc. with prepos.
(mihi propfer fe). Emphasis causes some departures from these
usages (Bacch. 162, tibi ego an tu mihi seruos es l).

b) Other pronouns: hic usually refers to the speaker, even when
connected with a second pers. pron: Trin. 828, hanc tuam gloriam,
“this of which Iam speaking ”3 Most. 7 53, hasce aedis tuas, “where
Inow am.” So hic homo = ego, Trin. 1115, etc.; hoc caput, Ps.
7233 haec canes, Trin.172. In the same way iste usually impliesa
reference to the person addressed and ille a reference to a third person.
But this distinction is not invariably observed.
