xlv INTRODUCTION.

lacked the poetic imagination, is a just distinction. There
is slight evidence in Plautus of feeling for nature or of pro-
iound interest in man and his relation to life. From politics
he was doubtless shut out by police regulations‚ and as his
prime object was to furnish amusement, any serious contem-
plation of life was aside from his purpose. Yet the lact
must be recognized that the plays show not so much an
intentional avoidance oi serious thought as an entire insen-
sibility to it, and reveal plainly the limited range within
which the mind of the writer moved. The semi-lyrical
cuute'ce, like Trin. 223-27 5, would have afforded to a poet an
opportunity for something finer 3ηά truer than the rather
vague lines which Plautus has written.

But granting these limitations oi mind and experience, it
is not difficult to discover the qualities which made the
comedies oi Plautus popular. Varro's judgment wesin

ing oi character) Terentius, in sermonibus (dialogue) Plautus.
When they are at their best, the dialogue scenes express the
character and situation oi the speakers without seeming to
do so; they abound in puns and joking hits3 they move
quickly and lightly‚ and, above all else, they give the
impression that the writer is observing his characters with a
humorous sense oi their absurdities. Further, the intrigue
which forms the basis oi the plot is often in itseli tarcical
and amusing, 3ηά the characters though they are less linely
conceived than those ot Terence, prove their truth hythe
· iact that they are periectly intelligible to us, across all the
barriers oi race and the differences in civilization. In read-
ing the plays the reader must constantly keep in mind the
iact that they were written ior the stage and need the help
oi gesture and look and intonation to aid the interpretation.

conversatioual Latin oi his time; it is more nearly correct
