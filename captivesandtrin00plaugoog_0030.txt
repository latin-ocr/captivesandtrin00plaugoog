22. The uses oi the subjunctive in independent sentences
in Plautus differ from those in later Latin mainly in being
more direct, as is natural in conversation. Many cases ol
the subjunctive in clauses grammatically subordinate are in
fact independent; ag. .· ’

Mil. Glor. 1034, at scin quid tu iacias? True potentia] uses are
rather infrequeut.

Immune.

23· a) The present and the future are generally clearly distin-
guished. The future is used chiefly in connection with fut. indic.
When pres. and tut. are used together they express two successive acts:
Pr. 20, cape has tabellas: tute hinc narrato tibi, “take this letter
and (then) tell yourself the story ”; Ps. 31, 161, etc. Examples are
abundant.

b) Beside the various periphrastic equivalents of the impu, fac,
uide, cura, and the expressions oi prohibition with noli, caue, mitte,
and the perf. subjunc. with ne, Pl. uses also pres. subjunc. addressed to
a definite person (Capt. 186, ne postules; Asin. 469, molestus ne sis,
and often) and pres. impv. with ne: Amph. 530, ne corrumpe oculos;
Asin. 377, ne nega, etc.

Inrrnirivn.

24· a) Pres. is used lor fut. alter verbs of promising, etc: Merc.
631, promittebas te os sublinere meo patri; Asin. 699, hoc argen-
tum ferre speres; also alter dare, adiurare, minari, etc.

b) Infin. is found instead of acc. nith infin. after verbs of saying·
when the subject is the same as that of the main verb: Trin. 956,
aibat mandasse ; Capt. 2 56, cauisse ratus est 3 Capt. 194, ire dixe-

ram; Men. 539, dicam curare? = te curaturum esse (different
subject).

c) The infin. ol purpose is used after verbs ol motion: Most. 67, Ι

ire...uolo...parare; Trin. 1015, recurre petere; Bacch. 631,
. . . uenerat aurum petere; and after curro, abeo, exeo, mitto. This
construction is found also in poetry (Verg. Aen. 1. 527, non . . . Libycos

populare penatis uenimus) and is not an imitation of the Greek con·
struction.
